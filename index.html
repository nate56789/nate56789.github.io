        <p><b>Computational Social Choice</b> is the field combining many different areas of study. These areas
            include theoretical computer science, social choice theory, and more.</p>

        <p><b>Theoretical Computer Science</b> (in <i>very brief </i>summary) is a branch of computer science that
            focuses more
            on the mathematical components of computer science rather than just applications of these components.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Social Choice Theory</b> is a type of methodology for making equitable decision-making. Specifically,
            these decisions are based on user preferences, opinions, and interests and potentially other
            characteristics.
