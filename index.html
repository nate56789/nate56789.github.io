    Hello and welcome to this interactive chapter on Computational Social Choice. What is Computational Social Choice?
    Well ...

        <p><b>Computational Social Choice</b> is the field combining many different areas of study. These areas
            include theoretical computer science, social choice theory, and more.</p>

        <p><b>Theoretical Computer Science</b> (in <i>very brief </i>summary) is a branch of computer science that
            focuses more
            on the mathematical components of computer science rather than just applications of these components.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Social Choice Theory</b> is a type of methodology for making equitable decision-making. Specifically,
            these decisions are based on user preferences, opinions, and interests and potentially other
            characteristics. This decision that is reached needs to be more or less collective.

    Hopefully those definitions gave you some idea of where we are going in this chapter. Computational social choice
    is seen all over the place and this chapters will show you some of those examples as well as the underlying
    mathematical
    notion of how those examples can be expressed. Mainly, this chapter will be concerned with making decisions in
    elections
    of various forms and analyzing the pros and cons of different election rules. Let us begin with the simplest
    definition which is that of a voter.

    This definition directly follows from the real-world concept of a voter. The next few definitions will similarly
    follow from real-world concepts.

        The <b>Plurality Rule</b> for voting is when we only consider the top-ranked candidate for each voter. Then
        the candidate that is top-ranked the most times is the winner of the election.

        Real Life Example
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        The plurality rule is essentially what the United States uses for its elections. Each state lists its
        first preference choice and then across all states the candidate with the most first choice across each state
        (multiplied by some electoral college weight for population) is the victor. Note that this does not necessarily
        imply
        that the winning candidate got the majority of the votes/is the most preferred.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="exercise card" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#model-5">
    <div class="cExampleHeader card-header">
        Example
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        Consider the following table of voting where the first row indicates the number of people with that permutation
        preference list for those candidates.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Alice</td>
                <td>Alice</td>
                <td>Bob</td>
                <td>Charlie</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bob</td>
                <td>Charlie</td>
                <td>Charlie</td>
                <td>Alice</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Charlie</td>
                <td>Bob</td>
                <td>Alice</td>
                <td>Bob</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        Then Alice gets 6 first choice votes, Bob gets 4, and Charlie gets 4. So, Alice would be the winner.
        However, note that Alice would not win a head to head with both Bob and Charlie even though she wins against
        both
        at the same time. Consider Alice vs Charlie. Then Alice would get $(2+4) = 6$ first place votes but Charlie
        would get
        $(4+4) = 8$ first place votes. So, Charlie would have won if Bob was not present. We will explore what this
        property
        is called below.

                <td>2</td>

                <td>Bob</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Charlie</td>

                <td>Bob</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        Note that there are a total of 13 voters so it takes 7 votes to reach a majority. In the first round Charlie
        gets 6 first place votes so a majority is not reached. Therefore we eliminate the person with least first-place
        votes which in this case would be Alice. Then in the next round with just Charlie and Bob, Charlie gets
        $2+4+6 = 12$ first-place votes and Bob would get just 1 first-place vote. Therefore Charlie would be declared
        the winner since he got the majority.

       For the previous table Alice has $3$ first place votes, Bob has $4$ and Charlie has $6$. So since Bob and Charlie

        same as in the previous example.

                <td>Bob</td>

        </table>

        In this table there are 3 candidates, so first-place gets 3 per voter, second-place 2, and third-place 1.
        Then for this table Alice gets $2*3 + 4*3 + 1*4 + 2*5 = 6+12+4+8=32$ for column 1,2,3,4 respectively.
        Using the same method Bob gets $2*2 + 4*1 + 4*3 + 5*1 = 25$ and finally Charlie gets
        $2*1 + 4*2 + 4*2 + 5*3 = 33$. So Charlie would be declared the winner. Note that if we were using the
        plurality rule then Alice would be declared the winner.
