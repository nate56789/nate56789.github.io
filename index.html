    Well ...

        <p><b>Computational Social Choice</b> is the field combining many different areas of study. These areas
            include theoretical computer science, social choice theory, and more.</p>

        <p><b>Theoretical Computer Science</b> (in <i>very brief </i>summary) is a branch of computer science that
            focuses more
            on the mathematical components of computer science rather than just applications of these components.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Social Choice Theory</b> is a type of methodology for making equitable decision-making. Specifically,
            these decisions are based on user preferences, opinions, and interests and potentially other
            characteristics. This decision that is reached needs to be more or less collective.

    Hopefully those definitions gave you some idea of where we are going in this chapter. Computational social choice
    is seen all over the place and this chapters will show you some of those examples as well as the underlying
    mathematical
    notion of how those examples can be expressed. Mainly, this chapter will be concerned with making decisions in
    elections
    of various forms and analyzing the pros and cons of different election rules. Let us begin with the simplest
    definition which is that of a voter.

        The <b>Plurality Rule</b> for voting is when we only consider the top-ranked candidate for each voter. Then
        the candidate that is top-ranked the most times is the winner of the election.

        Real Life Example
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        The plurality rule is essentially what the United States uses for its elections. Each state lists its
        first preference choice and then across all states the candidate with the most first choice across each state
        (multiplied by some electoral college weight for population) is the victor. Note that this does not necessarily
        imply
        that the winning candidate got the majority of the votes/is the most preferred.
    </div>

<div class="exercise card" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#model-5">

        Example
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        Consider the following table of voting where the first row indicates the number of people with that permutation
        preference list for those candidates.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Alice</td>
                <td>Alice</td>
                <td>Bob</td>
                <td>Charlie</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bob</td>
                <td>Charlie</td>
                <td>Charlie</td>
                <td>Alice</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Charlie</td>
                <td>Bob</td>
                <td>Alice</td>
                <td>Bob</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        Then Alice gets 6 first choice votes, Bob gets 4, and Charlie gets 4. So, Alice would be the winner.
        However, note that Alice would not win a head to head with both Bob and Charlie even though she wins against
        both
        at the same time. Consider Alice vs Charlie. Then Alice would get $(2+4) = 6$ first place votes but Charlie
        would get
        $(4+4) = 8$ first place votes. So, Charlie would have won if Bob was not present. We will explore what this
        property
        is called below.

                <td>Bob</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        Note that there are a total of 13 voters so it takes 7 votes to reach a majority. In the first round Charlie
        gets 6 first place votes so a majority is not reached. Therefore we eliminate the person with least first-place
        votes which in this case would be Alice. Then in the next round with just Charlie and Bob, Charlie gets
        $2+4+6 = 12$ first-place votes and Bob would get just 1 first-place vote. Therefore Charlie would be declared
        the winner since he got the majority.

        In this table there are 3 candidates, so first-place gets 3 per voter, second-place 2, and third-place 1.
        Then for this table Alice gets $2*3 + 4*3 + 1*4 + 2*5 = 6+12+4+8=32$ for column 1,2,3,4 respectively.
        Using the same method Bob gets $2*2 + 4*1 + 4*3 + 5*1 = 25$ and finally Charlie gets
        $2*1 + 4*2 + 4*2 + 5*3 = 33$. So Charlie would be declared the winner. Note that if we were using the
        plurality rule then Alice would be declared the winner.

                    <td>Charlie</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Bob</td>
                    <td>Charlie</td>
                    <td>Charlie</td>
                    <td>Alice</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Charlie</td>
                    <td>Bob</td>
                    <td>Alice</td>
                    <td>Bob</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            So, Alice would be the winner here by plurality rules (easy to verify).
            Consider Alice vs Charlie without Bob. Alice would get $(2+4) = 6$ first place votes but Charlie
            would get
            $(4+4) = 8$ first place votes. So, Charlie would have won if Bob was not present rather than Alice.
            Additionally, Charlie would also have won against Bob by similar logic. So this example shows plurality is not condorcet consistent.

           Under Borda count, Alice gets $4+4+3+2+2=15$, Charlie gets $3+1+2+4+1=11$, Bob gets
            $2+2+4+3+3=14$ and Derek gets $1+3+1+1+4 = 10$. So, Alice would be declared the winner under Borda
            Count rules. However, note that Bob, in a one-on-one with any of the other candidates, would be
            declared the winner. So this counterexample shows Borda Count is not Condorcet Consistent.

   The above two results are actually very interesting (and surprising) because intuitively one of the two rules
    is one that you would most likely pick to use if you were doing an election. However, in both cases it may very well
    occur that the winner you select is not actually preferred by most voters. This can easily be a reason why it
    frequently seems like a majority of individuals may be upset with election results (when the election is strictly
    more than 2 candidates). It also exposes what could be considered a flaw in our voting system.

            This follows from what we want to show. Assume that the voting rule satisfies condorcet consistency.
            Then we want to show that a candidate having a majority of first place votes implies that the candidate
            is the winner. If a candidate has the majority of first place votes, then in any pairwise election, that
            candidate will still have more first-place votes than the other candidate since they have a majority. Then
            by definition of condorcet consistency, this implies that this candidate would be the winner. Therefore
            the voting rule would also be majority consistent.

   These results are actually very interesting because they show that condorcet consistency is actually stronger
    than the majority criterion which intuitively may not make sense as they both seem equally strong. The last thing

        For this chapter, all the proofs and prose is entirely written on my own (I wrote it up after
        reading through different sources on voting and computational social choice). I wrote up the definitions
        myself in my own words after reading the sources. The proofs I came up with myself and same with all of the examples
        (except those about real-life usages of the different voting rules). Nothing in this chapter was copy-pasted.
        Finally, I also came up with the CYU questions and the exercises.
